Hey, if you're on my Github page, chances are you already find me interesting in real life, but now you're wondering if I'm really as work obsessed as I claimed to be.

I recently graduated from my Masters in Computer Science (didnt feel like Bachelors was enough :P) because I wanted a deeper dive into the *'Research Coming to Life'* aspect of Machine learning. 

And now with all the knowledge I have gained, I love building impactful and meaningful applications, or protoyping with any new technology I come across - cos why not!

I love to read research papers, and have written one of my own ( with 5+ citations! WOW ) on Extractive Summarization with Graph Neural Network and Named Entity Recognition. P.S this was before ChatGPT became popular.

Would love to discuss more and be happy to connect. Feel free to reach out to me on usinha3@illinois.edu
