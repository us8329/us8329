coded so hard they call me bob the builder ;}

Hey, if you're on my Github page, you might already find me interesting in real life, but now want to see if I am a workaholic (as I may have mentioned in our conversation) or not. 

I recently graduated from my Masters in Computer Science, which I decided to pursue after my bachelors in Computer Science because I wanted to learn more about Machine learning and as not ready to give my Scholar hat. 

And now with all the knowledge I have gained, I love to build scalable applications which may have some kind of impact to right audience. 

I love to read research papers, and have one of my own ( with 5+ citations! WOWOW )  on Extractive Summarisation using popular NLP techniques. P.S this was before ChatGPT got famous. 

Would love to discuss more on this - reach out to me to usinha3@illinois.ed
